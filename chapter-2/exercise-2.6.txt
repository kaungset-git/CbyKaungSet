Exercises 2.6
Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements:
---

a)  printf( "The value is %d\n", &number );

    printf( "The value is %d\n", number );

    An ampersand is not necessary before number because we are only printing a
    value, not saving to memory.


b)  scanf( "%d%d", &number1, number2 );

    scanf( "%d%d", &number1, &number2 );

    We are saving a value to memory here, therefore the variable number2 also
    should be proceeded by an ampersand.


c)  if ( c > 7 );{
      printf( "C is less than 7\n" );
    }

    if ( c > 7 ) {
      printf( "C is less than 7\n" );
    }

    The semicolon to the left of the left brace would make it so that the statement
    does nothing. Remove the semicolon.


d)  if ( c => 7 ) {
      printf( "C is equal to or less than 7\n" );
    }

    if ( c >= 7 ) {
      printf( "C is greater than or equal to 7\n" );
    }

    => is a backwards way of saying "greater than or equal to". Flip those (>=)
    and the operator would be valid.
