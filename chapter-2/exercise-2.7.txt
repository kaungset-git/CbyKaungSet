Exercises 2.7
Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements. (Note: there
may be more than one error per statement.)
---

a)  scanf( "d", value );

    Missing percent and ampersand, should be:
    scanf( "%d", &value );

b)  printf( "The product of %d and %d is %d"\n, x, y );

    Missing third variable, should be:
    printf( "The product of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, z );

c)  firstNumber + secondNumber = sumOfNumbers

    Backwards, should be:
    sumOfNumbers = firstNumber + secondNumber

d)  if ( number => largest )
       largest == number;

    Missing braces, incorrect operator. Should be:
    if ( number >= largest ) {
      largest == number;
    }

e)  */ Program to determine the largest of three integers /*

    Should be:
    /* Program to determine the largest of three integers */

f)  Scanf( "%d", anInteger );

    Scanf should be lower-case, missing ampersand. Should be:
    scanf( "%d", &anInteger );

g)  printf( "Remainder of %d divided by %d is\n", x, y, x % y );

    Missing the third %d. My guess here is that 'x % y' should be a variable. But
    I can't find a good example of this in the chapter.

    remainder = x % y;

    To say:
    printf( "Remainder of %d divided by %d is %d\n", x, y, remainder );

h)  if ( x = y );
      printf( %d is equal to %d\n", x, y );

    Missing braces and left quote. Should be:
    if ( x = y ) {
      printf( "%d is equal to %d\n", x, y );
    }

i)  print( "The sum is %d\n", x, y );

    One too many arguments, "f" is missing from "printf". Should be:
    printf( "The sum is %d\n", x );

j)  Printf( "The value you entered is: %d\n, &value );

    printf should be lowercase, missing closing quote, unnecessary ampersand. Should be:
    printf( "The value you entered is: %d\n, value" );
