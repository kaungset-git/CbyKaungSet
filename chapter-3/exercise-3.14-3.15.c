// Exercise 3.14
// Write a single pseudocode statement that indicates each of the following:

a) Display the message "Enter two numbers".

   Print "Enter two numbers"


b) Assign the sum of variables x, y, and z to variable p.

   Calculate the sum of x, y, and z and assign the total to p.


c) The following condition is to be tested in an if...else statement:
   The current value of variable m is greater than twice the current value of
   variable v.

   If variable m is greater than variable v times two
      print "True"
   else
      print "False"


d) Obtain values for variables s, r, and t from the keyboard

   Input a value for s, r, and t



// Exercise 3.15
// Formulate a pseudocode algorithm for each of the following:
a) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, compute their sum and display the
   results.

   Input the first value
   Input the second value
   Add the first value and the second value together
   Print the total

b) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display which (if either)
   is the larger of the two numbers.

   Input the first number
   Input the second number

   If the first number is greater than the second number
      print "The first number is larger"
   else
      print "The second number is larger"

c) Obtain a series of positive numbers from the keyboard, and determine and
   display thier sum. Assume the user types the sentinel -1 to indicate "end
   of data entry".

   initialize total

   while a number is entered that is not -1
     add number to total

   print total
